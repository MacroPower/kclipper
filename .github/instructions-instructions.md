# Instructions for writing copilot instructions

## Avoiding Unwanted Patterns

You can use this prompt to help with rephrasing instructions:

```md
I need help rephrasing instructions for an AI to avoid unintentionally reinforcing unwanted patterns. 

My current instruction is:

<instruction>
Paste the problematic instruction here
</instruction>

The issue is that when I explicitly mention what NOT to do, the AI seems to fixate on those examples.

Help me reword this instruction to:

1. Focus only on the desired outcome/pattern
2. Avoid mentioning the unwanted pattern entirely
3. Provide clear, positive guidance that will prevent the unwanted behavior

Suggest multiple alternative phrasings that accomplish the same goal.
```
